### Your First Code Contribution

Don't know about how to start contributing to CSC 510 HW1, you can look at begineer and help-wanted issues.

[Begineer issues](https://github.com/search?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner+label%3Ahelp-wanted+user%3Aatom+sort%3Acomments-desc) - issues which 
are just basic and require only few lines of code or minimal test cases.

[Help Wanted Issues](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted+user%3Aatom+sort%3Acomments-desc+-label%3Abeginner) - issues which are 
a bit more complex and many people actually face them.

The above issues mentioned are sorted according to the number of comments, though the number of comments may not be the best parameter still as the number of comment
increases we know that most of the people have faced similar issue, so it is a recurring issue. 
It will also demonstrate what impact the given change will have.
